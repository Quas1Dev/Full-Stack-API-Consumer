# Full-Stack API Consumer

This project I built for a challange. It consists of an web app with 5 distinct pages containing:

- A login form for the user login.
- A list of random users generated by the Random Users Generator.
- A cat image generated by the HTTP cat API, which returns a cat image for a given HTTP status code.
- A random dog image generated by the Random Dog API.
- A list of clients retrieved from a MongoDB Atlas database I keep online.

I used Vite to bootsrap a ReactJS + Typescript web app. Pure CSS was used to style the pages. This app consumes some commonly used packages, like axios, phosphor-react, react-modal.

For the backend, I set a NodeJS server built with the Express package. This server is used to communicate to a MongoDB database, which is a task accomplished using the mongoose package.

The front-end is deployed in Netlify, and the backend is on Azure.
